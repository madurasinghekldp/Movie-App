        as reviews, ratings, and personal watchlists. This enhances the user experience by enabling film lovers to 
        share opinions, discover new movies through recommendations, and track their viewing history. Some databases 
        also include integration with streaming services, making it easier for users to locate where they can watch 
        specific films. Overall, movie databases are essential platforms for organizing the vast world of cinema and 
        connecting viewers with the films they love.
